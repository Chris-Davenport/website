hand-coded website
Hi Everyone!

Crystal here, I like HTML, CSS, JQuery and Javascript.This is my 2018-19 revised promotional website. I am handcoding to showcase my skill and have a bit of fun. The users are small business owners, startups who need a print presence, large companies needing design/web consultants and large companies who need full-time help.
